# CodeLite Shortcuts

## View

- `Ctrl+``: Toggle the output pane.
- `Ctrl+m`: Toggle all the panes.  
  Love this feature. It only show the text editor area. But it's buggy, cannot bring the panes back, need to use menu View/Workspace Pane to toggle.
- `Ctrl+Tab`: Activate the next open file, select from the list.

## Text

- `TAB`: Move selected block to right
- `Shift+TAB`: Move selected block to left
- `Alt+->`: Cascade, e.g. an HTML <ol> group
- `Ctrl+k`: If a text is selected in the editor, use this shortcut to find and select another match in the editor
  (so you will end of with two selections). You can then edit these selections simultaneously.
- `Ctrl+Shift+k`: Similar to the above, but select all occurrence in the editor instead of doing it incrementally.
- `Ctrl+Backspace`: Delete to start of word.
- `Ctrl+Delete`: Delete to end of word.
- `Ctrl+Shift+Backspace`: Delete to start of line.
- `Ctrl+Shift+Delete`: Delete to end of line.
- `Ctrl+Z`: Undo last action.
- `Ctrl+Shift+Z`: Redo last action.
- `Ctrl+X/C/V/A`: Cut/copy/paste, select all.
- `Ctrl+L/D`: Line cut/duplicate.
- `Ctrl+Shift+T/L`: Line copy/delete.
- `Ctrl+T`: Line transpose with previous.

## Motion

- `Ctrl+Home`: Go to start of document.
